# Getting started with Data Science by cleaning up data sets

This is my first case study where I using some code to perform data cleaning on sales data.
The data is from [Keith Galli´s Github repository](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks) which contains 12 files from Jan to dec 2019

The goal was to do the following: rename the variables columns, handling missing values and handling data types.
